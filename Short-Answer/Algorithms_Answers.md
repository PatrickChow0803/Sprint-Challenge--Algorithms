#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) = Linear Time, there is only one operation performed for each iteration while a < n^3


b) O(n log n), the for loop is complexity O(n), and the nested inner loop is complexity O(log n).
   j is multiplied by 2, getting it half way closer to n.


c) O(n), the recursive call is called once per n
